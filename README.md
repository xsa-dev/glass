ü§ñ **Fast, light & open-source**‚ÄîGlass lives on your desktop, sees what you see, listens in real time, understands your context, and turns every moment into structured knowledge.

üí¨ **Proactive in meetings**‚Äîit surfaces action items, summaries, and answers the instant you need them.

ü´•Ô∏è **Truly invisible**‚Äînever shows up in screen recordings, screenshots, or your dock; no always-on capture or hidden sharing.

## Instant Launch

‚ö°Ô∏è ¬†Skip the setup‚Äîlaunch instantly with our ready-to-run macOS app.  [[Download Here]](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/znid09apxiwtwvxer6oc9/Glass_latest.dmg?rlkey=gwvvyb3bizkl25frhs4k1zwds&st=37q31b4w&dl=1)

## Quick Start (Local Build)

### Prerequisites

First download & install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download).
If you are using Windows, you need to also install [Build Tools for Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)

Ensure you're using Node.js version 20.x.x to avoid build errors with native dependencies.

```bash
# Check your Node.js version
node --version

# If you need to install Node.js 20.x.x, we recommend using nvm:
# curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash
# nvm install 20
# nvm use 20

# Or simply use the .nvmrc file (recommended):
nvm use
```

### Installation

```bash
# Use the correct Node.js version (automatically detected from .nvmrc)
nvm use

# Install dependencies and setup the project
npm run setup
```
